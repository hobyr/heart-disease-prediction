# Heart Disease Prediction

In this data science project, I used machine learning models to determine
whether a person has heart disease or not, based on a variety of chosen
health attributes.

I sourced the data from the [UCI Machine Learning
Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease).


## Type of machine learning problem

Binary classification problem:
1 = Has heart disease
0 = No heart disease

## Tech stack

* **Python**
* _Data Manipulation & Exploration_: Pandas, NumPy
* _Visualization_: Matplotlib/Seaborn
* _Machine Learning_: Scikit-Learn
